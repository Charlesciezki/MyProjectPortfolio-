	<h2><b><font color="white">Starting DevCode Camp</font></b></h2>
	<div><p><font color="white"><b>Today 12-14-15 I started my new schooling at DevCode Camp in, Milwaukee, Wi. As my mother dropped me off I found myself rather nervous for the tasks that lay ahead, I quickly realized that I was just excited to leave my old life, and the old me behind. Class starts and we all gather around, to introduce ourselfs and get to know eachother. As the class went around and talked about themselfs I found myself getting even more calm, as I felt like I finally found a safe place to learn and grow. We had a lecture and went about our tasks for the day. As the day came to a close, I could only think of what a wonderful opportunity I had at my doorstep</b></font></p></div>
	<h2><b><font color="white">First Website is coming together.</font></b></h2>
	<div><p><font color="white"><b>Today 12-17-15 was a big break through for me, I put up my first HTML, and it feels great. The knowlege I've gotten through Devcode has helped me create something that is personalized by me, and something I can be proud <b><font color="black">of. My</font></b> website features a Home page which contains links to an about me section, a blog, and the start of my portfolio. For now my portfolio only contains my gloving page that I created yesterday. I'm truly on an adventure for knowlege now.</b></font></p></div>
	<div><h2><b><font color="white"><b>First test is complete.</font></b></h2></div>
	<div><font color="white">Today 12-18-15 I took my first test in DevCode Camp, and I did pretty well, if I do say so myself. I prepred by spending the night before adding more onto my portfolio website, which again, is coming along very nicely. I'm excited to see what the next week of learning Javascript will bring me!</b></font></div>
